**Systems Architect | AI Security & Adversarial Testing**

25 years in IT and manufacturing. I design systems, break AI models, and ship production code — often all three in the same week.

Over the past two years, I independently built 30+ enterprise systems (MES, AI visual inspection, IoT automation) as a solo developer, all ISO 27001:2022 compliant. Before that, I spent 11 years delivering factory systems across 4 TSMC fabs and ran a software company for 20 years managing teams of up to 30 engineers.

Now I focus on LLM security — probing model behaviors across Chinese, English, and Japanese. Safety filters trained on English often fail against cross-lingual prompt injections, and that's where I come in.

## What I Build

**AI Security & Red Teaming**
- [ai-red-team](https://github.com/seikaikyo/ai-red-team) — LLM adversarial testing toolkit. 96 attack templates across 5 categories in EN/ZH/JA
- [git-security-hooks](https://github.com/seikaikyo/git-security-hooks) — Pre-commit secret scanning with gitleaks
- [git_cleaner](https://github.com/seikaikyo/git_cleaner) — Git sensitive data detection & cleanup for GitHub/GitLab

**AI Applications**
- [ai-english-tutor](https://github.com/seikaikyo/ai-english-tutor) — Voice-first English speaking practice with AI grammar correction
- [DashAstro](https://github.com/seikaikyo/DashAstro) — Astrology analysis + AI-powered tarot readings

**Developer Tooling**
- [dash-devtools](https://github.com/seikaikyo/dash-devtools) — Validation, E2E testing & AI vision analysis CLI toolkit
